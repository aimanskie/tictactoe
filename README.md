A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

So this is the readme for the tictactoe project

Tictactoe is a game that has 2 players filling up or marking the board with X or O's in a board and try to get it in a line with THREE in a row. Whoever gets the marking three in a row wins. 

So this project started of with having all the three lines working first. The idea was to extract all possible combinations of winning such as line 1,2,3 or 1,4,7 and you get the idea. By having those combinations helped get the winning function working by matching all the marked cells and if at least one line is matching thats the winner. 

The whole idea was how to get the players switching and by knowing how to pass around that information in the function, so the != expression was used every time we changed the players. It acts like a switch, when one player has finished we switch. 

At this time i did get help by checking in with Stack Overflow to get ideas on how to match the players to win. It was quite a daunting task to do the if else statement for each possible combinations as there were two players as well. So i learnt about the some and every statement together with the All the Rest expression to make the array easier to check each one.
